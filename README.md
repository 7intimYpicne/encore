Legend of Yun Xi was awesome !! The Male lead is drool worthy , protective of his sweet wife (female lead) and always has her back in everything ! This is a very typical light hearted fluffy romance fantasy drama
 
I absolutely love Princess Weiyoung!! That and Moonlight Drawn by Clouds have been my favorites so far. I would recommend The Rise of Phoenixes on Netflix. The first 3/4 of the series is amazing but the ending kind of disappointed me. But the beginning and middle more than make up for the disappointing ending.
 
Instead of due to being childhood sweetheart, the general actually started to be interested in Pingting due to her playing Qin. Later, he eventually fell deeper for her due to her brilliant tactics (which most of the time were used against him?).
 
Anyway, right after Moonlight Drawn by Clouds, I watched Sungkyunkwan Scandal and loved it! A very smart woman disguised as a boy who got roped into attending a university where woman are not allowed. It had all the elements I enjoyed in Moonlight Drawn by Clouds. There are 20 episodes. Highly recommend! It takes place in the same period of time as Moonlight.
 
I LOVE Strong Woman Bong Soon from a romance perspective, but there is a side crime story that I thought was a bit odd. I also thought Accidentaly In Love, (Netflix) was a great romance. Love 020, the movie is also fun especially if you play online games. The series of the same name has additional backstory, but I like the female lead in the movie better. I like a HEA and they are sometimes hard to find in Asian movies and series but all three of these have HEA.
 
Hey Ilona If you liked Tuoba Yu then I think you would totally dig the male lead in Princess Jie You. In this drama the male lead occasionally gives off a Jack Sparrows vibes, is a tease and fights like Legolas!
